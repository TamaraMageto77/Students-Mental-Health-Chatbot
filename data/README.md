## About the Dataset

### Context

This dataset is a curated collection of questions and answers sourced from two prominent online counseling and therapy platforms. The questions span a wide range of mental health topics, including anxiety, depression, relationship issues, stress management, and more. The answers are provided by qualified and experienced psychologists, ensuring the responses are accurate and reliable. The primary purpose of this dataset is to facilitate the fine-tuning of language models, enhancing their capability to generate appropriate and helpful advice in response to mental health-related queries.

This dataset is a valuable resource for anyone looking to advance the field of AI-driven mental health support. By leveraging the real-world data it provides, developers and researchers can create more empathetic, accurate, and effective tools to assist individuals dealing with mental health challenges.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The dataset is designed to support the following tasks:

- **Text Generation:** Particularly focused on generating advice or suggestions in response to mental health-related questions.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Enhancing AI models to understand the context of mental health discussions.
- **Conversational AI:** Developing AI models capable of engaging in empathetic and informative mental health conversations.

### Languages

- **Language:** English

The entire dataset is composed of text data in the English language, making it suitable for training and testing English language models.

### Data Instances

Each data instance in the dataset consists of the following fields:

- **Context (string):** This field contains the question asked by a user. It represents the mental health-related query that requires a response. (The user's question, covering various mental health topics.)
- **Response (string):** This field contains the corresponding answer provided by a psychologist. The response is a professional and well-considered piece of advice or guidance. (The psychologist's answer, providing advice, guidance, or information related to the user's query.)

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was curated with the specific goal of aiding in the development of AI models that can effectively provide mental health advice or guidance. Given the sensitive nature of mental health, the dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure that only the conversations relevant to mental health topics were included. This ensures the quality and focus of the dataset on the intended use case.
